<h2>Main Page</h2>

<p>This is the main front page, the index. In development, the baseurl doesn't work because I haven't added it in the config.yml. So clicking the site title should take you here because it is assigned to the baseurl. Instead, it just reloads the page you are already on. So in dev, if you want to see this page, you can't link-click your way here. You have to put it in the address bar.</p>
